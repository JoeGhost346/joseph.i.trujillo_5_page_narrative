            <h2>The Midweek Walk</h2>
            <div class="story">
                <p>Wednesday afternoon finds Alex walking the familiar campus paths once more, but there's something different in the air today. The week has settled into its rhythm, and the afternoon light feels more established, more confident. The campus has a sense of purpose about it, as if it's fully awake and engaged in the business of learning and growing.</p>
                
                <p>The afternoon sun casts its golden light across the quad, but today it feels more intense, more focused. Students move with the confidence that comes from being halfway through the week‚Äîthey know where they're going, they know what to expect. The campus feels alive with the energy of midweek productivity.</p>
                
                <p>Alex walks past the same buildings, the same trees, the same fountain, but they feel different today. The familiarity has deepened into something more meaningful‚Äîthese aren't just places anymore, they're part of a routine, part of a life that's taking shape day by day.</p>

        <div class="story">
            <p>As Alex continues the walk, the afternoon light begins to take on a different quality‚Äîwarmer, more golden, more inviting. The shadows grow longer, stretching across the pathways like fingers reaching toward evening. The campus feels like it's settling into itself, comfortable in its role as a place of learning and growth.</p>
            
            <p>The walk continues past the old bell tower, its chimes marking the half-hour with a melody that has echoed across decades of students' lives. The afternoon light catches the edges of everything, highlighting details that might have been missed in the morning's rush.</p>
