        <h1>Wednesday</h1>

        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Wednesday afternoon found Alex walking the familiar paths of campus once more, but this time with a different energy. The midweek hustle was palpable as students moved with purpose between classes. The afternoon sun was stronger today, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the campus buildings.</p>
            
            <p>The walk began at the student union, where the afternoon crowd was bustling with activity. Groups of students sat at outdoor tables, their laptops open and coffee cups steaming in the cool afternoon air. Alex could hear snippets of conversations about upcoming exams, weekend plans, and the latest campus events.</p>
            
            <p>As the path wound through the arts quadrangle, the afternoon light illuminated the sculptures and installations that dotted the landscape. The shadows they cast created interesting patterns on the walkway, and Alex found themselves pausing to appreciate the interplay of light and form. The afternoon was perfect for such contemplative moments.</p>
            
            <p>The walk continued past the music building, where the afternoon air was filled with the sounds of practice sessions. Through open windows, Alex could hear piano melodies, violin scales, and the occasional burst of laughter from students taking a break. The afternoon seemed to amplify these sounds, making them feel more intimate and personal.</p>
            
            <p>By the time Alex reached the far end of campus, the afternoon was beginning to wane. The walk had been both familiar and new, a chance to see the campus through fresh eyes. The afternoon light had revealed details that morning walks often missed, and Alex felt a renewed appreciation for the beauty of their college home.</p>
