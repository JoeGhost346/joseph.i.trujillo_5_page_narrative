            <p>The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the college quadrangle as Alex walked between the towering brick buildings. The air was crisp with the promise of autumn, and fallen leaves crunched softly underfoot. Students hurried past in small groups, their backpacks heavy with textbooks and their minds filled with the day's lectures.</p>
            
            <p>Alex's footsteps echoed against the cobblestone path that wound through the heart of campus. The afternoon light filtered through the ancient oak trees, creating a mosaic of light and shadow on the ground. A gentle breeze carried the distant sound of laughter from the student center and the faint aroma of coffee from the campus café.</p>
            
            <p>As Alex approached the library, the afternoon sun began its slow descent, painting the sky in warm hues of orange and gold. The building's Gothic architecture seemed to glow in the fading light, its stained glass windows catching and reflecting the sun's rays. Students sat on the steps, some studying, others simply enjoying the beautiful afternoon.</p>
            
            <p>The walk continued past the science building, where the afternoon light created interesting patterns on the modern glass façade. Alex could see students in lab coats moving about inside, their silhouettes visible through the large windows. The contrast between the old and new architecture of the campus was particularly striking in the afternoon light.</p>
            
            <p>By the time Alex reached the edge of campus, the afternoon was giving way to early evening. The walk had been peaceful, a moment of reflection in an otherwise busy day. The college grounds had provided the perfect backdrop for a contemplative afternoon stroll, with each building and pathway telling its own story of academic pursuit and personal growth.</p>
